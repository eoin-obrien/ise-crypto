    "# CBC Padding Oracle Attack\n",
    "\n",
    "Padding might seem harmless, but if we can just figure out whether PKCS#5/PKCS#7 padding is correct or not, we can decrypt the entire message. A padding oracle is some function that tells us whether the padding of a given ciphertext is correct or not. In reality, this is a very common vulnerability in web applications! It might be present as an error returned to the caller, or through a side-channel attack, such as noticing that the server takes longer to respond when the padding is correct. AWS's s2n implementation of TLS ended up disabling support for CBC mode altogether after it was found to be vulnerable to the timing attack version in 2015... a full 13 years after the attack was first published!"
